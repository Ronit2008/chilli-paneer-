1- Cut paneer into cubes. To a large bowl, add 3 tablespoons cornstarch, 3 tablespoons flour along with salt, pepper.

2- Add water to make a free flowing batter, it should neither be thick nor thin. I added little less than 1/2 cup water here. Meanwhile heat oil in a wok/kadai on medium heat to deep fry the paneer.

3- Dip each paneer cube into the batter.

4- And then add them into the hot oil.


5- Fry until the paneer pieces get golden brown and crispy from both sides. Drain the fried paneer on paper towel.

Meanwhile, in a measuring jar or bowl, add soy sauce (I use regular and dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon each), rice vinegar, green chili sauce, tomato ketchup and sugar. Mix until all is well combined and set aside.

Also mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water until cornstarch dissolves completely and set aside.

6- Heat sesame oil and avocado oil in wok on medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic, celery and green chili. Saute for 1 minute.

7- Then add the quartered onion and peppers.

8- Cook for 2 minutes. Veggies should remain crunchy and you should cook on high heat.


9- Add in the prepared sauce and mix and lower heat to medium.

10- Then add in the prepared cornstarch slurry. Mix well, sauce will begin to thicken. Add additional 3 to 4 tablespoons water.

11- Stir in the fried paneer cubes. Toss to combine the paneer with the sauce.

12- Turn off heat and garnish with green onions.
